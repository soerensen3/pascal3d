<p><h2 class=""><a name="whatismath3d"></a>What is math3d</h2>


<p>Math3D is a 3D mathematics library for pascal. It supports vector types, matrices and quaternions so far. Like GLM (C++ only), the syntax tries to be as close to <b> glsl </b> as possible.

<p>Additionally there is support for quaternions.

<p>In Math3D, for convenience, vectors and matrices are defined as objects (not classes) so they can be used like normal variables so you don't have to take care of creating or freeing them.

<p><b>Note:</b> This library is quite new so it will probably undergo some major changes in the future. In this early stage it is probably not suitable for a productive use. However I would be happy to receive some feedback!

<p><h2 class=""><a name="differences"></a>Differences to glsl</h2>
 As already said math3d tries to be as close with the syntax to glsl as possible. However in some places, due to language restrictions or other reasons, it just can't be done.

<p><h3 class=""><a name="diff_matrix_order"></a>Matrix Order</h3>
 There are two different orders when using matrices, one is colum-major and one is row-major. The order only defines how matrices are stored in memory. See this if you want to know more: <a  href="http://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/row-major-vs-column-major-row-vectors-vs-column-vectors/">http://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2012/02/12/row-major-vs-column-major-row-vectors-vs-column-vectors/</a> When I started making my first library years ago I was using Direct3D while now I use OpenGL, but I was used to row-major-order so I left it at that. However the order in glsl is column-major. So in the future I will probably make a switch for changing the order if needed.

<p><h3 class=""><a name="diff_typenames"></a>Type names</h3>
 In Pascal it is common to use a T as prefix for types. What is mat4 in glsl becomes TMat4 in Math3D. The prefix is not a must but there would be a conflict with the constructors for TMat4. In glsl you also use mat4(...) as a constructor. In Math3D the constructors are available as well though technically they are not real constructors in a pascal sense (like TMat4.Create(...)).

 See <code>swizzling</code>.

<p><h3 class=""><a name="diff_matrix_types"></a>Matrix Types</h3>
 While glsl supports a lot of different sized matrices, Math3D currently only supports square matrix types, so they are only three defined. In most cases you only need square matrices so it will probably not change in the future.<hr noshade size="1"><span class="appinfo"><em>Generated by <a  href="http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net/">PasDoc 0.13.0</a> on 2014-10-12 13:51:18</em>
