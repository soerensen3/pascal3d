Make a binky is a game where you control a rabbit by typing commands into a command line. The only tricky thing is that the screen keeps moving faster and you have to avoid to get outside of the screen on either side. To make it a bit harder there are three kind of enemies which you should avoid as well.

List of possible commands:

  start - will start a new game.
  pause - will pause the current game or resume it if paused
  set X Y - will set the rabbit to the position XY eg. set 500 50

And that's it.

As there are no skill levels you can change the difficulty by resizing the window. I didn't have much time, so there are probably lots of bugs, because i'm writing my bachelor thesis at the moment and im running out of time there but i wanted to submit a game anyway.
Have fun playing my first (finished) game!

P.S. Written with Lazarus (Free Pascal)
no linux and mac os source code yet but i will upload at least linux code later.
The source-code should work with other platforms though (not tested!)
