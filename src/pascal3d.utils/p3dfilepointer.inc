  Description:
    Introduces a file pointer class to check if loaded files have changed and then notify the user. A file pointer list is used to manage all opened files and
    automatically check for changes.

  { TP3DFilePointer

    A pointer to a file which may or may not exist. It is used internally to manage all open files. If Reload is executed the file
    status is updated. True is returned if the file changed. If assigned the file changed callback is run.

    Internally used to manage files opened by the engine. CheckForChange needs to be called in a regular interval if you want notifications to work. This
    is done automatically in the main loop in p3dapplication.inc for P3DFilePointers var.
