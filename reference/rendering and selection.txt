rendering
1. gathering objects
  1.1. Meshes with final positions
    split up to materials and merge together same references to meshes for instancing
    for transparent materials this should be done in batches for small parts and bigger parts should stand for themselves
  1.2. Lights with final positions
2. sorting of objects
  2.1. in opaque materials order doesn't really matter for visuals so sort by material
  2.2. in transparent materials order should be from far to near
  2.3. make sections from this where each section is a draw call or has at least the same settings
3. draw pass
  --- (for each section) ---
  (needs to be done for each shader without uniform buffer objects)
  3.1 pass settings to shader I
    3.1.1. material
    3.1.2. camera (view and projection)
    3.1.3. lighting
  --- (for each object in section) ---
  3.2 pass settings to shader II
    3.2.1. world transforms (for instanced rendering use a texture)
  3.3. draw the object
  ------------------------------------


queries (like actor picking)
1. gather objects
  1.1. All actors with final positions
