node: test
input: { name:"test1", type:"text" }
---

```{ name:"test_output", type:"shader" }
this is a test output!

Here we want test1 to appear:
$test1:assign$

Should list test declaration
$all declaration:assign$
```


---
node: test_input1
input: { name:"nested_input", type:"text" }
---

```{ name:"declaration", type:"shader"}
Test Declaration
```

```{ name:"test_output", type:"shader"}
Test Input 1 Works!
$nested_input:assign$
```

---
node: test_input2_nested
---

```{ name:"declaration", type:"shader" }
Nested Declaration
```

```{ name:"test_output" }
Test Input 2 Works!

```
